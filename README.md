# webpackstarter
Simple webpack starter scaffolding (client)

Pull down this repo using `git clone git@github.com:jaylandro/webpackstarter.git`

Run `npm install`

Run `npm start`

Any files located in src will be picked up by the webpack build which is started by running npm start.

Files with an extension of .js will be parsed by Babel allowing us to use all of ES6 features. Minified and built to build/bundle.js
Files with an extension of .css will be built in to a file in build/styles.css
